This observational study of the NGC 5394 and 5395 merging system, conducted with the $2.2m$ telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory (Spain), focused on the system's structure and stellar population. The study confirmed that NGC 5395 is a spiral galaxy, while NGC 5394 is hypothesized to be a barred spiral galaxy, pending further research. The presence of high population I stars and the distortion of the spiral arms in the intermediate region suggest that the galaxies are beginning to merge.
